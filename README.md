# J.A.R.V.I.S. - Virtual Assistant

J.A.R.V.I.S. is a virtual assistant implementation inspired by the AI personal assistant from Iron Man. This project uses JavaScript and the OpenAI GPT-4 API to provide virtual assistant and speech recognition functionality.

## Features

- Portuguese (Brazil) speech recognition
- Connection with the OpenAI GPT-4 API to provide text-based responses
- Brazilian Portuguese voice responses using the browser's speech synthesis API
- Voice activation and deactivation

## Requirements

- Browser compatible with the speech recognition API, such as Google Chrome
- OpenAI GPT-4 API key (replace the `API_KEY` value in `gpt4.js`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Replace the `API_KEY` value in `gpt4.js` with the API key provided by OpenAI.
3. Open the `index.html` file in Google Chrome or another browser compatible with the speech recognition API.
4. Say "jarvis listen" to activate speech recognition.
5. Say "GPT" followed by your question or command. For example, "GPT, what's the weather like today?"
6. The J.A.R.V.I.S. virtual assistant will respond using the GPT-4 API and the voice selected in the browser.
